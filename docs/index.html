        <h1>Privacy Policy for Fanfare Now</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 17, 2026</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how Fanfare Now ("we", "our", or "the app") handles information when you use our Android application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Fanfare Now does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user information.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The app is designed to be completely offline and privacy-focused. Specifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect any personal information</li>
            <li>We do not collect usage data or analytics that is transmitted off your device</li>
            <li>We do not collect device information</li>
            <li>We do not collect location data</li>
            <li>We do not collect any other data from your device</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Local App State:</strong> The app may store local app state (such as usage counters or preferences) on your device for app functionality. This data remains on your device only, is never transmitted externally, and does not require any special permissions. This is considered part of "the app's own resources" and is not considered data collection in the privacy sense.
        </p>

        <h2>Internet and Network Access</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Fanfare Now does not require or use internet connectivity.</strong> The app operates entirely offline and does not communicate with any external servers or services.
        </p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Fanfare Now does not request any permissions from your device.</strong> The app does not require access to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Internet or network connectivity</li>
            <li>Location services</li>
            <li>Camera or microphone</li>
            <li>Contacts or personal data</li>
            <li>Storage (except for the app's own private data directory, which includes local app state like counters or preferences)</li>
            <li>Any other device permissions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How the App Works</h2>
        <p>
            Fanfare Now is a simple utility app that plays a local audio file (fanfare sound) when launched. The app:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plays a pre-installed audio file from the app's resources</li>
            <li>Displays a visual icon during playback</li>
            <li>Automatically closes after the sound finishes playing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All functionality is performed locally on your device without any external communication.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Fanfare Now does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, advertising networks, or data collection services.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our app does not collect any information from anyone, including children. Since we do not collect data, we comply with all applicable children's privacy regulations.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Consent</h2>
        <p>
            By using Fanfare Now, you consent to this Privacy Policy. Since we do not collect any data, your use of the app does not involve any data processing that requires consent beyond your decision to install and use the app.
        </p>
